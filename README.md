I am a fourth-year PhD candidate in the Higher Education Administration & Policy program at University of Florida. With a background in gender studies, my work is positioned at the nexus of social justice and higher education. My current research interests center college access and choice for multiply-marginalized students and the use of critical mixed methods.
